The Quran feature includes all 114 surahs with Arabic text and English translations, complete with intuitive navigation. Prayer times are calculated for five daily prayers based on user-selected location. The Islamic calendar displays major festivals with both Gregorian and Hijri dates. The visual design employs an Islamic-inspired aesthetic with gold, emerald, and teal colors, geometric patterns, and elegant typography. All acceptance criteria are met.",

# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an Islamic companion application that provides Quran text with translations, displays major Muslim festival dates, and shows daily prayer times based on user location.

**Planned changes:**
- Add Quran reader with all 114 surahs displaying Arabic text and English translation with intuitive navigation
- Display calendar of major Islamic festivals (Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Ramadan dates) with both Gregorian and Hijri dates
- Implement prayer times feature showing all five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) with location selection
- Design Islamic-inspired interface with geometric patterns, elegant typography, and warm color palette (gold, emerald green, deep teal)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can read the Quran with translations, view upcoming Islamic holidays with dates, and check daily prayer times for their location, all within a beautifully designed Islamic-themed interface.
